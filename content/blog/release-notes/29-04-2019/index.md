### Improvements

- Change the personal job dashboard to be a 'Project Manager Dashboard', where you are now able to see all projects that you are
  a project manager for, the status of each job, and the status of each project.

### Changes

- Make the project status no longer be dependent on its job's statuses, it is now a field where you can mark the project as
  'Open' or 'Closed'
- Add on a new status to jobs called 'invoiced'. This is an automatic status and is unable to be altered by a user.
  A job will be considered 'invoiced' under 2 conditions, the first being when all of its deliverables are marked as invoiced,
  the second being when a job has no deliverables, and it is marked as 'complete'
