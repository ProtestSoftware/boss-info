### Improvements

- Change the personal job dashboard to be a 'Project Manager Dashboard', where you are now able to see all projects that you are
  a project manager for, the status of each job, and the status of each project.

### Changes

- Make the project status no longer be dependent on its job's statuses, it is now a field where you can mark the project as
  'Open' or 'Closed'
